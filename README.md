# Twitch Sheep

"Twitch Sheep" is a partial/unpolished Twitch chat sheep.

It is not just a bot it's more than that. You control what your chat can do. Why just give them the power to control mere LED's, SFX or Alexa (using speakers). When you can do all of that from just single app and custom code your own stuff. 

**NOTE : This is not an extension on twitch. This project is not affiliated or partnered by Twitch. This is an independent project made for my own stream but could be used by anyone.**

## Why this project?
I created this for my personal channel (show some love here : [hey24sheep](https://twitch.tv/hey24sheep)). **To make a single most powerful, customizable and no limit control room for my chat.** There is no project like this online (at least for now) I didn't find any. There are either specific use case librarys like linked below or just APIs that you can implement.

Other projects to control single specific thing:-
- [Screm](https://github.com/bfroggio/screm) (SFX)
- [LumiaStream](https://lumiastream.com/lumiatwitch) (Lights)
- StreamLabs or Stream Elements (Chat Commands + Timers)
